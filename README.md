# Complex-Numbers-Arithmetic
I created an extensive class that encompasses the majority of the functions we perform on complex numbers, from basic arithmetic to identifying the argument and evaluating any valid complex expression.

I used the concepts of operator overloading of binary and unary primitive operators in C++ in order to make the class more user-friendly.
